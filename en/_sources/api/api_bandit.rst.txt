Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration is given as a JSON file.
We show each field below:

.. describe:: method

   Specify bandit algorithm.
   You can use the algorithms below.

   .. table::

      ========================= ===================================
      Value                     Method
      ========================= ===================================
      ``"epsilon_greedy"``      Use epsilon-greedy.
      ``"epsilon_decreasing"``` Use Greedy Mix.
      ``"ucb1"``                Use UCB1
      ``"softmax"``             Use softmax
      ``"exp3"``                Use exp3
      ``"ts"``                  Use Thompson sampling [#]_  
      ========================= ===================================
   .. [#] Note that ``reward`` in register_reward API must be 0 or 1 when you use Thompson sampling method.

.. describe:: parameter

   Specify parameters for the algorithm.
   Its format differs for each ``method``.

   common
     :assume_unrewarded:
        Specify whether it can be omitted to call ``register_reward`` when the reward is zero.
        When it is True, calling ``register_reward`` can be omitted, but calling ``register_reward`` must be associated with the result of ``select_arm``.
        When it is False, although ``register_reward`` must be called when the reward is zero, it can be called independently of calling ``select_arm``.
        (Boolean)

   epsilon_greedy
     :epsilon:
        The probability of choosing arms randomly.
        With probability ``epsilon``, choose an arm according to uniform distribution.
        With probability 1 - ``epsilon``, choose the arm whose expectation value is the highest.
        (Float)

        * Range: 0.0 <= ``epsilon`` <= 1.0

     :seed(optional):
        Specify seed used to generate random number.
        If not specified, system clock is used as seed parameter.
        So you will get different result each experiment.

        * range of value: 0 <= ``seed`` <= :math:`2^{32} - 1`

   epsilon_decreasing
    :decreasing_rate:
        Decreasing rate for the probability of selecting arms randomly. The bigger this parameter is, the more slowly the probability decreases. (Float)

        * Range: 0 < ``decreasing_rate`` < 1
    
    :seed(optional):
        Specify seed used to generate random number.
        If not specified, system clock is used as seed parameter.
        So you will get different result each experiment.

        * range of value: 0 <= ``seed`` <= :math:`2^{32} - 1`

   ucb1
     None

   softmax
     :tau:
        Temperature parameter.
        For high temperature, all arms are selected equally.
        For low temperature, arms with higher expected value are frequently selected.
        (Float)

        * Range: 0.0 < ``tau``

     :seed(optional):
        Specify seed used to generate random number.
        If not specified, system clock is used as seed parameter.
        So you will get different result each experiment.

        * range of value: 0 <= ``seed`` <= :math:`2^{32} - 1`

   exp3
     :gamma:
        Mixture rate of constant weight and each arm's weight.
        The higher ``gamma`` is, the higher the rate of constant weight is.
        The lower ``gamma`` is, the higher the rate of each arm's weight is.
        (Float)

        * Range: 0.0 < ``gamma`` <= 1.0

     :seed(optional):
        Specify seed used to generate random number.
        If not specified, system clock is used as seed parameter.
        So you will get different result each experiment.

        * range of value: 0 <= ``seed`` <= :math:`2^{32} - 1`

   ts
     :seed(optional):
        Specify seed used to generate random number.
        If not specified, system clock is used as seed parameter.
        So you will get different result each experiment.

        * range of value: 0 <= ``seed`` <= :math:`2^{32} - 1`
     

Example:
  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "method" : "epsilon_greedy",
       "parameter" : {
         "assume_unrewarded" : false,
         "epsilon" : 0.1
       }
     }


Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. mpidl:message:: arm_info

   The state of an arm.

   .. mpidl:member:: 0: int trial_count

      Number of times of an arm being selected.

   .. mpidl:member:: 1: double weight

       The weight of an arm.
..       Higher ``weight`` means that the arm will get more rewards.

   .. code-block:: c++

      message arm_info {
        0: int trial_count
        1: double weight
      }
