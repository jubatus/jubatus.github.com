.. describe:: parameter

   Specify parameters for the algorithm.
   Its format differs for each ``method``.

   common
     :unlearner(optional):
        Specify unlearner strategy.
        If you don't use unlearner, you should omit this parameter.
        You can specify ``unlearner`` strategy described in :doc:`api_unlearner`.
        Data will be deleted by the ID based on strategy specified here.

     :unlearner_parameter(optional):
        Specify unlearner parameter.
        You can specify ``unlearner_parameter`` :doc:`api_unlearner`.
        You cannot omit this parameter when you specify ``unlearner``.
        Data in excess of this number will be deleted automatically.

   inverted_index
     None

   inverted_index_euclid
     :ignore_orthogonal(optional):
        Ignore the points which don't have any same key with the query when searching neighbors.
        If this option is specified, the result includes only points which have inverted index similarity with the query.
        In addition, this option contributes to accelerate calculation in specific cases (e.g. when most points don't have any same key).
        This parameter is optional and is ``false`` (disabled) by default.
        (Boolean)

   minhash
     :hash_num:
        Number of hash values.
        The bigger it is, the more accurate results you can get, but the more memory is required.
        (Integer)

        * Range: 1 <= ``hash_num``

   lsh
     :hash_num:
        Bit length of hash values.
        The bigger it is, the more accurate results you can get, but the more memory is required.

     :threads(optional):
        Specify the number of threads which execute random_projection and search.
        If ``threads`` is omitted, those are executed with 1 thread. 
        The bigger it is, query latency becomes smaller because data is divided into several parts and processed by multiple threads in parallel.
        This option has been added since 0.9.1. Single thread is used in before versions.
        (Integer)

        The behavior of this option varies as below:

        * ``threads`` < 0

          * threads is set to the number of logical CPU cores

        * 1 <= ``threads`` <= The number of logical cores of CPU

          *  The number of threads is set to ``threads`` .

        * The number of logical cores of CPU < ``threads`` .

          *  The number of threads is set to the number of logical CPU cores. In addtion, data points are divided into threads parts.

     :cache_size(optional):
        Specify the number of vectors to cache projection vectors for hashing.
        If ``cache_size`` is omitted, projection vectors are generated in each hash calculation.

        (Integer)

        * Range: 1 <= ``hash_num``

     :table_num:
        Number of tables.
        The bigger it is, the mroe results you can find, but the more memory is required and the longer response time is required.
        (Integer)

        * Range: 1 <= ``table_num``

     :bin_width:
        Quantization step size.
        The bigger it is, the more results you can find, but the longer response time is required.

        Specify the number of threads which execute random_projection and search(optional).
        If ``threads`` is omitted, those are executed with 1 thread. 
        The bigger it is, query latency becomes smaller because data is divided into several parts and processed by multiple threads in parallel.
        This option has been added since 0.9.1. Single thread is used in before versions.
