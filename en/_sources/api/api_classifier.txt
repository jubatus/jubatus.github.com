     :unlearner:
        Specify unlearner strategy.
        If you don't use unlearner function, you can omit this parameter.
        You can specify ``unlearner`` strategy described in :doc:`api_unlearner`.

Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. mpidl:message:: estimate_result

   Represents a result of classification.

   .. mpidl:member:: 0: string label

      Represents an estimated label.

   .. mpidl:member:: 1: double score

      Represents a probability value for the ``label``.
      Higher ``score`` value means that the estimated label is more confident.

   .. code-block:: c++

      message estimate_result {
        0: string label
        1: double score
      }

.. mpidl:message:: labeled_datum

   Represents a datum with its label.

   .. mpidl:member:: 0: string label

      Represents a label of this datum.

   .. mpidl:member:: 1: datum data

      Represents a datum.

   .. code-block:: c++

      message labeled_datum {
        0: string label
        1: datum data
      }


Methods
~~~~~~~

.. mpidl:service:: classifier

   .. mpidl:method:: int train(0: list<labeled_datum> data)

      :param data:  list of tuple of label and :mpidl:type:`datum`
      :return:      Number of trained datum (i.e., the length of the ``data``)

      Trains and updates the model.
      ``labeled_datum`` is a tuple of :mpidl:type:`datum` and its label.
      This API is designed to accept bulk update with list of ``labeled_datum``.

   .. mpidl:method:: list<list<estimate_result> > classify(0: list<datum> data)

      :param data:  list of datum to classify
      :return:      List of list of :mpidl:type:`estimate_result`, in order of given :mpidl:type:`datum`

      Estimates labels from given ``data``.
      This API is designed to accept bulk classification with list of :mpidl:type:`datum`.

   .. mpidl:method:: map<string, ulong> get_labels()

      :return:     Pairs of label and the number of trained data

      Returns the number of trained data for each label.
      If method is ``NN`` , the number of trained data that are deleted by ``unlearner`` is not include in this count.

   .. mpidl:method:: bool set_label(0: string new_label)

      :param new_label: name of new label
      :return:          True if the new label was not exist. False if the label already exists.

      Append new label.
      If the label is already exist, it fails.
      New label is add when label found in ``train`` method argument, too.

   .. mpidl:method:: bool delete_label(0: string target_label)

      :param target_label: deleting label name
      :return:          True if jubatus success to delete label. False if the label is not exists.

      Deleting label.
      True if jubatus success to delete. False if the label is not exists.
