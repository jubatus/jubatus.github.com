Basic Tutorial
==============

Before trying the tutorial, you need to install Jubatus and Jubatus Python client. See :doc:`../quickstart` for instructions.


Scenario
--------

This tutorial uses `News20 <http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/>`_ dataset (``20news-bydate.tar.gz``), which is  popular for experiments in text classification.
News20 has 20 different newsgroups and users post their message on a suitable newsgroup.
News20 is divided into learning data (20news-bydate-train, 80%) and experimental data (20news-bydata-test, 20%).

The goal of this tutorial program is to learn model from 20news-bydate-train and to guess the newsgroup to post from 20news-bydate-test.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Running Jubatus server in standalone mode

  * If you are interested in distributed mode, see :doc:`../tutorial_distributed` *after* this tutorial.

* Configuring Jubatus server via JSON style config
* Using Jubatus classification service via ``train`` and ``classify`` API
* Basic concepts of classification


Run Tutorial
------------

Run ``jubaclassifier`` program, which provides classification feature, specifying a configuration file. Examples of configuration file are stored in ``$PREFIX/share/jubatus/example/config`` directory.

::

  $ jubaclassifier -f /path/to/share/jubatus/example/config/classifier/pa.json
  I0110 13:43:07.789201  1855 server_util.cpp:250] starting jubaclassifier 0.5.0 RPC server at 192.168.0.1:9199

      interconnect timeout : 10
  I0110 13:43:07.789721  1855 server_util.cpp:77] load config from local file :/path/to/share/jubatus/example/config/classifier/pa.json

    "converter" : {
      "string_filter_types" : {},
      "string_filter_rules" : [],
      "num_filter_types" : {},
      "num_filter_rules" : [],
      "string_types" : {},
      "string_rules" : [
        { "key" : "*", "type" : "str", "sample_weight" : "bin", "global_weight" : "bin" }
      ],
      "num_types" : {},
      "num_rules" : [
        { "key" : "*", "type" : "num" }
      ]
    },
    "method" : "PA"
  }

Jubatus classification server is now started.
Jubatus servers listen on TCP port 9199 by default.
If you would like to use another port, specify it using ``--rpc-port`` option.
For example, to use port 19199:

::

  $ jubaclassifier  --configpath /path/to/share/jubatus/example/config/classifier/pa.json --rpc-port 19199

Jubatus and Jubatus clients communicate with each other in `MessagePack-RPC <http://msgpack.org>`_ protocol over the TCP/IP network.

.. blockdiag::

    blockdiag single_single {
      group classifier{
      color = "#77FF77"
      jubaclassifier;
      }

      group client{
      color = "#FF7777"
      client;
      }

      client -> jubaclassifier;
    }

OK, let's download the `tutorial program <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-tutorial-python>`_ and the dataset.

::

  $ git clone https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-tutorial-python.git
  $ cd jubatus-tutorial-python
  $ wget http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/20news-bydate.tar.gz
  $ tar xvzf 20news-bydate.tar.gz

Reboot `jubaclassifier` with ``config.json`` , which is a configuration file prepared for this tutorial.
Note: do not use the previous configuration file ( ``pa.json`` ) that was used above.

::

  $ jubaclassifier --configpath config.json

Then, run the program.

::

  $ python tutorial.py

Now you see the result of classification!
For each message, ``OK`` means that Jubatus estimated the label correctly, and ``NG`` means that estimated label was wrong.

Read below for more detailed description.

Dataset
~~~~~~~

After expanding ``20news-bydate.tar.gz``, you see files like this:

::

  20news-bydate-train
  |-- alt.atheism
  |   |-- 49960
  |   |-- 51060
  |   |-- 51119
  |   |-- 51120
  :   :     :
  |-- comp.graphics
  |-- comp.os.ms-windows.misc
  |-- comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
  |-- comp.sys.mac.hardware
  |-- comp.windows.x
  |-- misc.forsale
  |-- rec.autos
  |-- rec.motorcycles
  |-- rec.sport.baseball
  |-- rec.sport.hockey
  |-- sci.crypt
  |-- sci.electronics
  |-- sci.med
  |-- sci.space
  |-- soc.religion.christian
  |-- talk.politics.guns
  |-- talk.politics.mideast
  |-- talk.politics.misc
  `-- talk.religion.misc

``49960`` is one of messages and ``alt.atheism`` is one of newsgroups the message is posted.
For example, ``20news-bydate-train/rec.motorcycles/104435`` contains:

 In my case that's not for another 3+ years, so I'd appreciate any
 hints on what will keep the organization in business that long.  (And
 preferably longer, of course, and worth being part of.)

In this tutorial, we use these text as the training data.

Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using classification service, you need to setup a behavior of ``jubaclassifier`` with JSON as follows.
There are three configurable parameters: ``method``, ``converter`` and ``parameter``.
Example of these parameters is as follows.

.. code-block:: python

  {
    "method": "PA",
    "converter": {
      "string_filter_types": {
        "detag": { "method": "regexp", "pattern": "<[^>]*>", "replace": "" }
      },
      "string_filter_rules": [
        { "key": "message", "type": "detag", "suffix": "-detagged" }
      ],
      "num_filter_types": {},
      "num_filter_rules": [],
      "string_types": {},
      "string_rules": [
        { "key": "message-detagged", "type": "space", "sample_weight": "bin", "global_weight": "bin"}
      ],
      "num_types": {},
      "num_rules": []
    },
    "parameter": {}
  }

You can choose one of the following algorithms as ``method``:

- ``perceptron``
- ``PA``, ``PA1``, ``PA2``
- ``CW``
- ``AROW``
- ``NHERD``

We use ``PA`` in this tutorial.

``converter`` decides how to extract feature vector from input data (see :doc:`../fv_convert` for details).

In this tutorial, input data is text of natural language.
In many languages such as English, words can be extracted by just splitting with spaces and line breaks.
Jubatus supports this kind of feature vector extraction (in this case, from text of natural language into words) by default.
Additionally, HTML tags are noisy to classify the contents so we will remove the part that is enclosed in ``<`` and ``>``.

Using this feature, you can apply multiple rules such as natural language process and weighting of values.
These rules expressed as follows in JSON.

.. code-block:: python

  "converter": {
    "string_filter_types": {
      "detag": { "method": "regexp", "pattern": "<[^>]*>", "replace": "" }
    },
    "string_filter_rules": [
      { "key": "message", "type": "detag", "suffix": "-detagged" }
    ],
    "num_filter_types": {},
    "num_filter_rules": [],
    "string_types": {},
    "string_rules": [
      { "key": "message-detagged", "type": "space", "sample_weight": "bin", "global_weight": "bin"}
    ],
    "num_types": {},
    "num_rules": []
  }

Use of Classifier API: Train & Classify
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Call ``train`` API (RPC method) to update models in the classifier.
In the following example, ``d1`` is a datum constructed from a message, and ``"comp.sys.mac.hardware"`` is a label (name of newsgroup) for the message.

.. code-block:: python

  d1 = Datum({"message" : "I want to buy mac book air..."})
  client.train([("comp.sys.mac.hardware", d1)])

Repeat training the model using many instances of labels and messages in this way.

Now, call ``classify`` API to analyze with models.
``d2`` is a datum constructed from a message, but you don't know the newsgroup the message was posted to; so let Jubatus predict it.

.. code-block:: python

  d2 = Datum({"message" : "Just bought a new mac book air..."})
  result = client.classify([d2])

The result is as follows.

.. code-block:: python

   [[
        ["comp.sys.mac.hardware", 1.10477745533],
        ...
        ["rec.sport.hockey", 0.2273217487300002],
        ["comp.os.ms-windows.misc", -0.065333858132400002],
        ["sci.electronics", -0.184129983187],
        ["talk.religion.misc", -0.092822007834899994]
   ]]

So, it seems that the message ``d2`` was posted to ``"comp.sys.mac.hardware"``.
