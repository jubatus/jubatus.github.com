Quick Start
===========


Install Jubatus
---------------

We officially support Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.2 or later (64-bit) and Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS / 16.04 LTS (64-bit).
On supported systems, you can install all components of Jubatus using binary packages.

Other Linux distributions (including 32-bit) and Mac OS X are experimentally supported.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 or later (64-bit)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command to register Jubatus Yum repository to the system.

::

  // For RHEL 6
  $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.jubat.us/yum/rhel/6/stable/x86_64/jubatus-release-6-2.el6.x86_64.rpm

  // For RHEL 7
  $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.jubat.us/yum/rhel/7/stable/x86_64/jubatus-release-7-2.el7.x86_64.rpm

Now install ``jubatus`` and ``jubatus-client`` package.

::

  $ sudo yum install jubatus jubatus-client

On RHEL 6 systems, we use ``rhel-6-server-optional-rpms`` or ``jubatus-optional`` repository to install dependency package (``oniguruma``).
If the installation command above fails with the missing ``oniguruma`` package error, try one of the following commands:

::

  // For RHEL 6 systems that cannot find oniguruma package
  $ sudo yum --enablerepo=rhel-6-server-optional-rpms install jubatus jubatus-client

  // For RHEL 6 systems that cannot find oniguruma package (and rhel-6-server-optional-rpms is unavailable)
  $ sudo yum --enablerepo=jubatus-optional install jubatus jubatus-client

Optionally you can install plug-ins.  [1]_ [2]_
By installing plug-ins, Jubatus can perform feature extractions from Japanese natural language text and images.

::

  $ sudo yum install jubatus-plugin-mecab jubatus-plugin-ux jubatus-plugin-image jubatus-plugin-python

.. [1] Prior to Jubatus 1.0, all plugins were bundled with ``jubatus`` package.  In Jubatus 1.0 or later, you can selectively install plug-ins you need.
.. [2] A part of fuction in ``jubatus-plugin-image`` package (``ORB`` algorithm) and ``jubatus-plugin-python`` package are not available in RHEL 6.

Ubuntu Server (64-bit)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write the following line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jubatus.list`` to register Jubatus Apt repository to the system.

::

  // For Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) - Deprecated (unsupported)
  deb http://download.jubat.us/apt/ubuntu/precise binary/

  // For Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
  deb http://download.jubat.us/apt/ubuntu/trusty binary/

  // For Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)
  deb http://download.jubat.us/apt/ubuntu/xenial binary/

Now install ``jubatus`` package.

::

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install jubatus

Currently our package is not GPG-signed.
Bypass the warning by answering ``y`` to the prompt when asked:

::

  Install these packages without verification [y/N]? y

Now Jubatus is installed in ``/opt/jubatus``.

Each time before using Jubatus, you need to load the environment variable from ``profile`` script (you can add the line to ``~/.profile``).

::

  $ source /opt/jubatus/profile

If you're using csh or tcsh, use this instead:

::

  $ source /opt/jubatus/profile.csh

Docker
~~~~~~

You can use Docker image distributed at Dockerhub.

::

  $ docker pull jubatus/jubatus
  $ docker run --expose 9199 jubatus/jubatus jubaclassifier -f /opt/jubatus/share/jubatus/example/config/classifier/pa.json

Other Linux Distributions (including 32-bit)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `jubatus-installer <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-installer>`_ or see :doc:`../developers/build` to build from source.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

If you're using Homebrew, you can use `tap repository <https://github.com/jubatus/homebrew-jubatus>`_ for installation.

In other case, use `jubatus-installer <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-installer>`_ or see :doc:`../developers/build` to build from source.

Install Jubatus Client Libraries
--------------------------------

Jubatus client applications can be written in C++, Python, Ruby or Java.
You need to setup the client library for each language to use Jubatus from client applications.
Client libraries are distributed under MIT License.

If you're going to try :doc:`../tutorial/tutorial`, just install Python client and go ahead.

Version of Jubatus and Jubatus clients may be different, as clients are not updated when there are no API changes to Jubatus.

C++
~~~

The client is included in the Jubatus framework (``$PREFIX/include/jubatus/client/*_client.hpp``) and no additional setup is required.

If you don't have compilers and/or development headers installed, you will need to setup them.
For RHEL systems, type:

::

  $ sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools" "Additional Development"

For Ubuntu systems, type:

::

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

Python
~~~~~~

The client (requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.x) is available in `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jubatus>`_.

::

  $ sudo pip install jubatus

If you only have Python 3.x, you may need to use ``pip3`` instead of ``pip``.

If you don't have ``pip`` command, run the following command:

::

  $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
  $ sudo python ez_setup.py
  $ sudo easy_install pip

On Ubuntu, you can also use ``python-pip`` package to install ``pip``.

Ruby
~~~~

The client (requires Ruby 1.9 or later) is available in `RubyGems <http://rubygems.org/gems/jubatus>`_.

::

  $ sudo gem install jubatus

Java
~~~~

The client is available in our Maven repository.
Please add these lines to ``pom.xml`` of your project.

Write Your Application
----------------------

Congratulations!
Now you can write your own application using Jubatus.
See the :doc:`../api/index` for what Jubatus can do.

Skeleton projects are also available:

- `C++ Client Development Skeleton <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-cpp-skeleton>`_
- `Python Client Develoment Skeleton <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-python-skeleton>`_
- `Ruby Client Develoment Skeleton <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-ruby-skeleton>`_
- `Java Client Development Skeleton <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-java-skeleton>`_ (Eclipse project template)

In the `jubatus-example <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-example>`_ repository, you can see applications using Jubatus.
