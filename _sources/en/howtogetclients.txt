How to Get Clients
-------------------------------------

There are two ways in getting a client code of each service in each language.

- Get pre-generated client from `download page in github <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus/downloads>`_ 

- Generate client code with msgpack-idl and .idl file

In the following section, we explain these methods in detail.

Use pre-generated client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained later, client codes are generated from msgpack-idl. But if you want to use client code casually, it is recommended that you should use the client that is already generated by Jubatus developers.

You can download these clients from here `this download page <https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus/downloads>`_ .


Generate clients from msgpack-idl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can generate client codes by `msgpack-idl <http://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-haskell/tree/master/msgpack-idl>`_ .idl file.
msgpack-idl is an idl compiler written in Haskell and .idl file is a specification file of msgpack-idl.  This program requires ghc7 and cabal.
The followings are exapmle of generating clients (and servers). In this exapmle, we generate clients of classifier.

::

  $ cabal install msgpack-idl
  $ mpidl cpp classifier.idl -o . -p
  ...
  $ ls
  classifier_types.hpp classifier_client.hpp classifier_server.hpp

Owing to this code-generating system, application developers can easily support clients written in multiple programming languages.
